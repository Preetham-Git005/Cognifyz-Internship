# Cognifyz Internship – Data Engineering

This repository contains my completed tasks during my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**.

# 🚆 Indian Railway Data Analysis – Internship Project at Cognifyz Technologies

This repository showcases my Data Engineering internship project completed at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The project focuses on exploring, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing Indian Railway train data using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is structured into **4 levels**, each designed to simulate real-world data engineering tasks:

---

## ✅ Level 1: Data Exploration and Basic Operations

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Performed basic statistical analysis
* Identified and handled missing values
* Standardized station names (e.g., uppercase formatting)

---

## ✅ Level 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation

* Filtered data by specific days (e.g., Saturdays)
* Created subsets based on source stations
* Grouped data by source station and calculated:

  * Number of trains per station
  * Average number of trains per day
* Categorized trains based on operating days (Weekday / Weekend)

---

## ✅ Level 3: Advanced Data Analysis

* Analyzed journey distribution throughout the week
* Visualized trends using bar plots and histograms
* Identified patterns between source and destination stations
* Discovered correlations between days of the week and train frequency
* Generated insights and practical recommendations

---

## ✅ Level 4: Data Visualization and Reporting

* Built visualizations using:

  * **Matplotlib**
  * **Seaborn**
  * **Plotly**
* Created bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps
* Compiled a comprehensive final report summarizing findings and insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Outcome

This project helped me build strong hands-on experience in:

* Real-world data cleaning and transformation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data aggregation and enrichment
* Visualization and stakeholder-ready reporting
